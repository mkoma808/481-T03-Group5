# P1: Animal Genealogy Mobile App

## Project Idea

This project is a mobile application on Android geared towards enthusiasts, hobbyists and heritage animal breeders. This application is a visual family-tree based, genealogical overview of all the user’s animals over time. It is intended to be a lightweight application that can be run on any android platform using a visually lightweight UX to simplify and streamline the task of genealogy bookkeeping.

This application will be used by those who are looking for a way to easily view all of their past and previous animals, and calculate their inbreeding coefficient, a common concern in small breeders. This application is not intended to be used on a very large scale or by corporate animal breeders, nor is it intended to be used for genetic haplotyping by agricultural scientists.

The app is being commissioned by the American Kennel Club in order to better track family trees in registered and small breeders, to combat increasing inbreeding issues, as well as to better track animals after they have been rehomed to new owners out of contact with the original breeders. In addition, scientists and agricultural statistics analysist at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada have expressed their interest in the app and its potential to increase the pool of genetically valuable animal stock at the consumer level. Several other stakeholders have expressed interest in the application, acknowledging that there has been unfilled gap in the tech application market  for animal genealogy since the 1980s. 


## Stakeholders and Users

The primary users of this app are the breeders themselves. The primary stakeholders in the development in the app will be the American Kennel Club, and likely any other kennel club or species registry that wishes to adopt this application for use. Other users and stakeholders  of the app may include, but are not limited to: clients who which to peruse their animal’s heritage before buying, Purebreed clubs, farmers and ranchers who keep livestock, small private breeding companies, specialists in animal artificial insemination, breeding industry consultants, biology and genetics teachers, etc. 
For the sake of analysis, the project will focus on the following users and stakeholders: small and reputable breeders of varying species, customers of breeders, ranchers of large livestock, and pedigree club breeders, and the American Kennel Club. The following table will identify these key stakeholders and users, and relevant information that may impact the design and use of the app. (See Fig. 1)

## User Research Methods

The following user research methods were chosen to research the problem of animal genealogy: Interview (Ask) , Historical Analysis (Learn) , and Competitive Product Survey (Learn).

Because of the niche nature of animal breeding and the long-term nature of the practice, it is very difficult to put into practice many of the methods from the Look and Try categories of IDEO methods. Since the demographic of animal breeders targeted by this app is made up of mostly enthusiasts and registered, established single breeders, it is much more viable to utilize methods from the Ask category. However, it was difficult to contact established breeders and veterinarians on short notice. Therefore, only one Ask IDEO method was employed. In contrast, because there is a well recorded tradition of animal breeding due to the establishment of many kennel clubs, purebred registries, and agricultural livestock syndicates, it is significantly easier to look into historical records of breeding methods and habits, utilizing the Historical Analysis method. In addition, because this app is aimed at a very specific niche market, it is very easy to research any direct product competitors available to animal breeders. Thus, the Competitive Product Survey was chosen as a counterpart to the historical nature of the Historical Analysis method. 


### User Research Method 1: Interview - Ask

TICA issued family tree

The task of tracking animal genealogy is often that of a mental exercise, and it is difficult to observe this during the mundane everyday tasks and routine of taking care of various animals. As learned from secondary research, many animal breeders are from older generations and may use their own proprietary methods of keeping track of their breeding stock by hand. It is important to know what access to technology these people have and if they would even be willing to attempt to move their (possibly decades or more) of breeding logs into an electronic form. Furthermore, it may be difficult to find breeders willing to show us their logs, and breeders of farm animals mostly live too far away for us to physically meet them.

The interview was conducted on a cat breeder registered under TICA (The International Cat Association) known to a group member through family. 

Q: How do you keep track of the genealogy of your animals?

* Just going to do it by hand.

Q: What issues do you have with this method?

* When a cat registered through TICA, only the parents of the cat are listed, and a full genealogy is only available through them at a cost.

* Usually only 5 generations of a cat's genealogy are tracked through TICA.

* Cannot request genealogy of a cat that you do not own, except by contacting the breeder/owner of the cat.

* Usually want more than 3 generations of separation.

Q: What would you like a genealogy app to do for you?

* Literally anything above the bare minimum would be better than using TICA.

* Must mail everything into TICA, if you are outside of the US, you must pull out American currency from the bank and send it to them as payment.

* It can be difficult to find other breeders - much information is spread by word of mouth.

* Very hard to verify that other breeders are actually registered purebreds.
 
Q: Have you ever had any issues with inbreeding?

* No, but because most breeder info is passed by word of mouth, it is very easy to scam other breeders into cross-breeding with unregistered cats.

Q: Do you think these issues could have been avoided with a proper genetic history of
your animals?

* Yes, absolutely.

Additional Notes

* Many breeders are our parents age and are not as proficient with technology.

* Maybe have a website and mobile app.

* TICA has a list of breeders in alphabetical order, but no other information on the breeder or their location.

Summary 
During this interview with a cat breeder, we learned that, for the cat breeding registry TICA, much of the pedigree information that is necessary for the operation of breeders is very difficult to obtain, and sometimes impossible. There is a large problem with finding the reputability of breeders and whether their animals are registered or not, and the information that can be found is very slow to communicate. It seems that most breeder information is passed by word of both because there are no adequate listings for registered breeders under the TICA. Most breeders are an older generation, which may suggest why these communication methods have worked for so long; however, there is demand for an animal genealogy app because there is nothing else available. 


### User Research Method 2: Analysis – Learn 

This method compares features of an industry and practices at different levels of scale in the animal genealogy field. This method helps identify trends and cycles of product use and customer behavior; in this case, the use and effect of registries and record keeping in animal genealogy, and its relevance to dog owners. Modern styles of breeding imply extensive record keeping, and so the use of historical analysis offers a uniquely detailed outlook on breeding trends over the last century. The historical analysis was conducted using statistical genetic studies of pedigree stock in different species (primarily dogs) to determine common trends and a possible connection of inbreeding coefficient and time. This was done to determine the effectiveness and relevance that this app would have in the animal breeding field. 

The historical analysis and dissemination of the roles humans have played in the genetic diversity of heritage and purebred species is as follows: 

The practice of animal breeding is irrevocably tied to the development of human agricultural civilization and animal domestication [^fn]. However, modern animal breeding as we know it today, at both the hobbyist and industrial scale, came into being around the 19th century with agricultural revolution and emergence of pedigree breeding. Long practiced though never formalized, the 19th century saw the establishment of modern kennel clubs, breed standards, and the foundation of today’s animal husbandry practices.

Purebreeding animals is, to many, an extension of the mentality of the late Victorian era, where purebred dogs were bred from a narrow set of ancestors for their “purity”, representing a narrow percentage of the population’s “goodness” being extenuated into further offspring. This attitude finds it’s reflections in todays approach to purebred eugenics; being accused of following  "a breeding paradigm that is anachronistic in the light of modern genetic knowledge, and that first arose out of a misinterpretation of Darwin and an enthusiasm for social theories that have long been discredited as scientifically insupportable and morally questionable.”

Today, the word pedigree has come to mean an animal that has had its ancestry recorded, often tracked by major registries. Pedigree animal regardless of species, often suffer from health defects and issues from genetic issues amplified by repeated inbreeding in the pursuit of certain desirable traits. Though there has been regulation put into place by major registries to help prevent these issues from an ethical standpoint, the nature of pedigree and heritage breeding is that the gene pool will constantly shrink and eventually suffer from inbreeding depression, even collapse of the breed, without introduction of outside stock to diversify the genetic pool.

Due to the historical origins from which the practice of purebred animals originated, the contemporary practice of breeding under a registry remains much the same as it was in the Victorian era, though breeders today take greater care to avoid inbreeding if possible. However, practices such the overuse of show winners as popular sires, or mating between related animals, have changed little over the years and further diversity loss, evidence for which is given using the following inbreeding coefficient trends.

In academic studies of population structure and inbreeding from pedigree dogs, there were extremely inbred dogs in nine out of ten breeds examined, corresponding to about eight generations. For seven out of ten breeds, >90% of unique genetic variants are lost over six generations, genetic diversity that is crucial to the vitality of successive generations. Additionally, every breed examined, the inbreed coefficient is assumed to be 0 from founding members—a number that is unrealistic because the history of most breeds, and dogs themselves, extends far beyond the breed founders in known records. As time increases, there are additional generations of ancestors recorded, and so the inbreeding coefficient tends to increase. This is a trend that is roughly constant over generations regardless of breed, indicating little change in mating patterns and thus, the breeding practices of pedigree breeders. A similar practice in livestock breeding with an emphasis on milk-production has produced a number of health problems in cows.

Pedigree analysis studies have concluded that as a consequence of historical genetic bottlenecks, many breeds of different speeds have experienced considerable diversity loss, particularly purebred dogs. The popular sire phenomenon is one of the most problematic breeding practices, and the practice should be limited such as carefully limiting the number of offspring litters and loosening genetic barriers to promote genetic variability, crossing similar breeds to introduce diversity. 
Insurance companies providing health insurance for dogs determine the premium based on dog ancestry, and so pedigree dogs often require very high premiums because of poor genetics in the greed. 48% of animal veterinarians actually advise against clients choosing certain pedigree dog breeds because of their predisposed health issues.

In summary, the traditional attitudes in pedigree breeding has carried forward into contemporary practice, and has led to dangerous lack of diversity in many species, particularly in dog breeding. This has ripples beyond the breeding club field, as pet insurance providers and pet owners are also affected by the lack of healthy genetic stock within breeds. An application that could easily calculate the inbreeding coefficient between animals of many breeders, small and professional breeders, would be a very useful tool in helping to prevent any more loss of diversity.
