## Introduction

Animal Genealogy Application, or AGA (as of yet, otherwise unnamed) is a mobile application on the Android platform that aims to streamline family tree tracking of animal genealogies, and simplify inbreeding coefficient calculations, for professional and hobbyist domesticated small animal breeders. It is intended to be a lightweight application that can be run on any android platform using a visually lightweight UX to simplify and streamline the task of genealogy bookkeeping. 
AGA was developed in collaboration with the American Kennel Club, with the aim of reducing the issue of genetic stock shrinkage in purebred dogs, and improving communication between owners and registry. Long term goals of the application also include full implementation of a “social media” type of network between breeders that will also include search functionality of animals for studding or showcase. The aim of this is to increase ethical transparency of small-scale breeding operations by encouraging community between breeders.

## Design Problem

To design an easy to use piece of software that keeps track of animal genealogies at a consumer level.

## Design and Justification

  AGA is designed to present animals in an easy to view, navigable family tree that has “profiles” for every animal. Every animal can be directly verified through the app to their registry, eliminating a large amount of slow paperwork that registering animals currently involves. AGA allows you to search for other animals and breeders for show or stud. This facilitates communication in local breeder community and will lessen the genetic shrinkage brought by excessive use of siring pedigree show winners because of lack of available studding.

  AGA is intended to be simple, learnable, and accessible to everybody; particularly because a large part of the user group is older and less versed in smartphone technology. The primary function of the app is genealogy mapping and the design of the app reflects this. The home page is a view of your own animal family tree, with a floating button option to add another animal, presumed to be the most used function for a breeder. Other sections of the app are based on tab functionality, which allows the user to easily access all parts of the app without functionality being hidden behind a hamburger menu. 

#### Adding an animal profile to the family tree:

  The actual adding of an animal is a single-page affair, designed to be easy to exit but also to proceed. Because all of the relevant info to be added is on a single page, there is reduced chance for the user to slip and forget to add information because they are not prompted. The single page also gives the user a sense of control over the information that they are adding to the app, discouraging the user from withholding information out of fears of privacy. The information boxes are drop down menus or radio buttons wherever possible to simplify database issues and to reduce mistakes. The option to register your animal is default unchecked, and the prompt to enter a registration number is given when the user wishes to specific that their animal is a registered purebred. If the animal registration does not verify, the user is unable able to specify that their animal is a purebred to others. When the form is done, the user is taken back to the home view and is immediately able to view their animal and determine whether the addition was successful. 

#### Browsing other animals:
  
  The user can click on the tab for browsing other animals and is presented with an interface unique to that tab, making it very clear which mode they are in. The user is presented with a search bar where they can search for other animals and filter/sort them based on breeder distance, characteristics, and other options. When the user finds an animal they are interested in, they can click on the profile and be taken to their profile page. On that page the user can see the full details and pictures of that animal. The profile page can easily be exited out by clicking the back button to return to the search results where the user started from, ensuring that they do not lose their search progress. 

#### Calculating Inbreeding Coefficient:
  
  The user can calculate inbreeding coefficient of either their own animals, or an animal of his own and another breeders animal. Because the registry is natively tied to the app, and registered animals are required to present at least 3 generations of full purebred genealogy, there is a huge amount of genealogy data in relatively complete form that the app can draw upon. This eliminates the guesswork out of selecting an animal to breed with, as well as gives the user a very simple way of working with a very large amount of tedious data.
  
  From their own home menu, the user can select two animals and instantly be shown their connection and inbreeding coefficient. Or, the user can navigate to another animal’s profile and calculate the coefficient from that profile, selecting their own animal from the coefficient calculation menu drop down selection.  This ensures that the user is sure of which animals they are selecting from when calculating the coefficient. 


## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

The team heuristic evaluation identified a number of bugs and heuristic issues that could cause mistakes. 

Major issues that we identified:

* When adding an animal, both “Male” and “Female” radio buttons can be selected at the same time and cannot be un-selected.

* Heuristic: Error Prevention

* Severity: 4

* Page: Add Animal

Justification: If a user adds and animal with both the “Male” and “Female” radio buttons selected, undefined actions and errors may occur and propigate issues throughout the entire system, especially since the database will need to check the gender of animals when searching for compatible breeders.

Solution: Link the "Male" and "Female" radio buttons together so that only one can be selected at a time, and add error handling conditions to the database to allow the database to function even if there is an error such as this.
The “Facebook Login” button logs the user in without prompting them for any sort of authentication.

Heuristic: Consistency and standards

Severity: 4

Page: Login

Justification: Allowing a user to login to the app without prompting them for any sort of credencials is a serious stability and security issue. If a user logs in this way, would they have a unique user ID? Would all of the information they entered be lost once the app closed? Could you gain access to someone else's account by logging in this way? The fact that any of these questions must be asked is completely unacceptable, and this problem must be resolved as soon as possible.

Solution: Link the facebook login button to Facebook's API, and ensure that there is no way to login to the app without entering valid credentials.

You can go through the process of adding an animal without filling out any information about it.

Heuristic: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Severity: 4

Page: Add Animal

Justification: This app is meant to help breeders find other breeders and track the genealogy of their animals, in the world of purebreeding, it is absolutely essential that breeders have as much information about the animals that they are breeding as possible - allowing people to add animals without filling in relevant information about said animals completely defeats the purpose of this app and service.

Solution: Do not allow users to add an animal without filling out all of the relevant information about said animal, especially if it is being listed as a purebred.

When an animal is selected from the "Animal Overview" tab, it cannot be un-selected.

Heuristic: User control and freedom

Severity: 3

Page: P2

Justification: This is a serious usability issue for the user, not being able to unselect an animal will either cause serious confusion/frustration or errors with the code for the intended function (checking the breeding coefficient of two animals).

Solution: Make it so an animal can be unselected by tapping on it again, and do not allow the user to select more than two animals at once.


## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

  A fully dynamic family tree and scroll was not implemented fully in this iteration, and plans for the next immediate iteration of the design should include this implementation in full as it is the primary functionality of the app. This is the primary goal for the next iteration of the app and is feasible. Implementation of this could make use of the Google touch special navigation framework, the style of which is most popularly used in the Google Maps Navigation iphone/android apps. The navigation feature should aim to use the Schneiderman principals of heuristics for spatial data presentation. 

  Possible issues raised also included privacy issues for breeders not wanting to make certain animals or information public. A fix for this would be to allows users to set their own privacy settings of profiles and animals, similar to privacy settings found on social media network giant Facebook.  This is a simple fix that would turn animal searchability off depending on the privacy settings, and can be done by the next iteration. 

  Issues regarding of secure login credentials were raised during the heuristic evaluation. Given that sensitive personal information is in the app, two-part security authentication as well as the possibility of secure data encryption are suggested as possible improvements on this issue. Two-part security authentication is feasible by the next iteration, but is only a secondary goal behind the primary goal of family tree implementation. Two-part authentication should be implemented by the third iteration.  Secure data encryption libraries are available for use for small applications and allow this fix to be feasible by the third iteration. However, sensitive data such as registry numbers and personal information warrant the possibility of third-party privacy contractors for large scale data encryption, given that the app is being designed with the American Kennel Club registry and will need large-scale database implementation.

  Currently, there are not enough sort and filter options for search results, and as such is it difficult to search for animals that will meet specific enough requirements for possible breeding. The immediate fix for this is to increase the options given for the filter and sort menus. A secondary fix for this is to add a “message the breeder” button to all profiles, to contact the breeder and setup further communications and meetings directly from the profile. This is feasible by the next iteration and more filter and sort options should be implemented, though they are not the primary goal. 

  There are consistency issues with the selection of animals for inbreeding coefficient calculations for the user’ss own animals and the user’s animal with another breeder’s animal. The selection from the user’s own animals is simple, straightforward, and provides immediate feedback. However, the selection of another user’s animal for inbreeding coefficient calculations involves a completely different series of steps and GUI interaction, which is confusing. A possible fix for this is to make both types of selection more similar. One way to do this is to give the option to add another breeder’s animal to the user’s own home family tree of animals as a type of “ghost” entry, a selectable and viewable animal profile that can be interacted with in the family tree for coefficient calculations, without actually being a part of the user’s own animals. The distinction between this entry and the user’s own entry could be done by using different colours for different animals belonging to different breeders. This will require restructuring of the dynamic family tree view, and while the base fix is doable by the next iteration, it is more practical to wait until the dynamic family tree is full implemented before adding. 

  Long term goals for AGA involve the full implementation of a messaging system between breeders, and search capability for different breeders, not just for animals. Links or a button that allow the user to navigate to the breeder page from their animal would allow more seamless integration of this functionality into the existing app, and increase the user freedom and functionality.  This is not feasible for the next iteration of the app but is given as a directional guide for development, and will be revisited in the second or third iteration after full dynamic family tree functionality has been implemented. 


## Conclusions

  In summary, inbreeding presents a large problem on both an ethical and financial issue for breeders and the animal industry as a whole. There is a wide niche for the AGA application and opportunity to be implement the original design problem as well as expand into communications between breeder-to-breeder as well as breeder-to-registry. The AGA app is on it’s way to providing seamless animal genealogy tracking and breeder networking while remaining lightweight and accessible for the target users. AGA has the potential to be the first of its kind in an industry devoid of natively driven technological development.

  The current iteration had some bugs and design issues but provides a good framework for core bits of functionality for the primary functionality of genealogy tracking and breeder networking. Suggested fixes for the bugs and design issues are given for the next iteration of the design, and the long-term development goal of the app is also suggested given the current iteration functionality. The next iteration of the design should primarily be focused on a full implementation of the dynamic family tree, with minor tweaks to the privacy user settings and sort and filter options as a secondary goal, and minor bugfixes as a tertiary goal. Minor bugfixes will be ongoing throughout all iterations of the design, and so this should be the last priority.
