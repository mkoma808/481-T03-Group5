## Introduction

Animal Genealogy Application, or AGA (as of yet, otherwise unnamed) is a mobile application on the Android platform that aims to streamline family tree tracking of animal genealogies, and simplify inbreeding coefficient calculations, for professional and hobbyist domesticated small animal breeders. It is intended to be a lightweight application that can be run on any android platform using a visually lightweight UX to simplify and streamline the task of genealogy bookkeeping. 
AGA was developed in collaboration with the American Kennel Club, with the aim of reducing the issue of genetic stock shrinkage in purebred dogs, and improving communication between owners and registry. Long term goals of the application also include full implementation of a “social media” type of network between breeders that will also include search functionality of animals for studding or showcase. The aim of this is to increase ethical transparency of small-scale breeding operations by encouraging community between breeders.

## Design Problem

To design an easy to use piece of software that keeps track of animal genealogies at a consumer level.

## Design and Justification

  AGA is designed to present animals in an easy to view, navigable family tree that has “profiles” for every animal. Every animal can be directly verified through the app to their registry, eliminating a large amount of slow paperwork that registering animals currently involves. AGA allows you to search for other animals and breeders for show or stud. This facilitates communication in local breeder community and will lessen the genetic shrinkage brought by excessive use of siring pedigree show winners because of lack of available studding.

  AGA is intended to be simple, learnable, and accessible to everybody; particularly because a large part of the user group is older and less versed in smartphone technology. The primary function of the app is genealogy mapping and the design of the app reflects this. The home page is a view of your own animal family tree, with a floating button option to add another animal, presumed to be the most used function for a breeder. Other sections of the app are based on tab functionality, which allows the user to easily access all parts of the app without functionality being hidden behind a hamburger menu. 

#### Adding an animal profile to the family tree:

  The actual adding of an animal is a single-page affair, designed to be easy to exit but also to proceed. Because all of the relevant info to be added is on a single page, there is reduced chance for the user to slip and forget to add information because they are not prompted. The single page also gives the user a sense of control over the information that they are adding to the app, discouraging the user from withholding information out of fears of privacy. The information boxes are drop down menus or radio buttons wherever possible to simplify database issues and to reduce mistakes. The option to register your animal is default unchecked, and the prompt to enter a registration number is given when the user wishes to specific that their animal is a registered purebred. If the animal registration does not verify, the user is unable able to specify that their animal is a purebred to others. When the form is done, the user is taken back to the home view and is immediately able to view their animal and determine whether the addition was successful. 

#### Browsing other animals:
  
  The user can click on the tab for browsing other animals and is presented with an interface unique to that tab, making it very clear which mode they are in. The user is presented with a search bar where they can search for other animals and filter/sort them based on breeder distance, characteristics, and other options. When the user finds an animal they are interested in, they can click on the profile and be taken to their profile page. On that page the user can see the full details and pictures of that animal. The profile page can easily be exited out by clicking the back button to return to the search results where the user started from, ensuring that they do not lose their search progress. 

#### Calculating Inbreeding Coefficient:
  
  The user can calculate inbreeding coefficient of either their own animals, or an animal of his own and another breeders animal. Because the registry is natively tied to the app, and registered animals are required to present at least 3 generations of full purebred genealogy, there is a huge amount of genealogy data in relatively complete form that the app can draw upon. This eliminates the guesswork out of selecting an animal to breed with, as well as gives the user a very simple way of working with a very large amount of tedious data.
  
	From their own home menu, the user can select two animals and instantly be shown their connection and inbreeding coefficient. Or, the user can navigate to another animal’s profile and calculate the coefficient from that profile, selecting their own animal from the coefficient calculation menu drop down selection.  This ensures that the user is sure of which animals they are selecting from when calculating the coefficient.
