# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNeLHtq01xo&feature=youtu.be)

[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNeLHtq01xo&feature=youtu.be)

This video captures a single pet entry to the database. Very much similar to the storyboard it shows how a user would interact with the interface as if it were a real
application. The first part of the video was the loading screen of the interface and then after a second the login screen would appear requesting an email and a password
or a Facebook login. Once the user enters the information it would take them to the home screen. Where they can see their pets. On the home screen you can search and you can have  drop down menu. In this case their wasn't any animals so at the bottom right you can request to add an animal. Once you do that you go to another page where you can specify if its a cat or dog you would like to add and some information regarding the pet. Once that happens you press next and you can upload a few images or you could "take a picture" which uses the camera on your device. You can upload as many pictures as you would like. It will let yo know if you added a picture successfully and after that's all done you would be asked to enter more information. If the pet is a purebred you would be asked to upload a certificate, upload a family tree which is optional,add a sire, add a dame, and add a registration number. Once that's all done you can submit your information which will be checked to verify your information. After you submit you would be directed back to the home screen where the animal you added will be upload.

## Storyboard

This storyboard is used to illuistrait Task I from P1.

Task I: User wants to add single pet entry to database. They user would be specified to add a single entry after creating an account with detailed history of the pet.


![](https://mkoma808.github.io/481-T03-Group5/images/P2/Picture1.jpg)

1.	User logs into app
2.	User clicks on the "+" button on the bottom righthand corner of the screen to add the animal.
3.	The user fills out basic information about the animal such as: name, species, breed, gender, age, and whether it is a breeding animal.
4.	The user uploads some picture of their animal, or takes some pictures of their animal. They will also be asked to take pictures of their animal from specific angles and distances so other breeders or buyers can see the features of the animal (so as to prevent fraud). Photo recognition technology could also be integrated to help automatically identify features of an animal (like it's coat or pattern).
5.	The user is then asked to enter detailed information on the traits of the animal (breed specific traits will also be loaded), such as it's length, height, eye colour, coat/pattern, ect. If the animal is purebred, the owner may also be asked to take pictures of the animal with a ruler or measuring tape next to it.
6.	If the animal is purebred, the owner will be asked to upload pictures of their animal's certificates to verify the authenticity of their claim. They will also be asked to enter any information about the animal's family tree that they have, and the registration numbers for the animal. The certificates will then be checked and the user will receive a notification when their animal has been authenticated as a purebred.

    <td class="tg-yw4l">Should include a button for “make a new<br>account” and “forgot your login” which<br>are common login problems. This is the first screen that will pop up when the<br>app is opened, which eliminates issues about not being logged in.</td>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">This is often easily missed in real world-applications.<br>Perhaps a tutorial or even a “ghost” profile of an already existing animal<br>should be present in order to show the user what the screen is for. Perhaps<br>adding the clause “a new screen will appear when the button is clicked” will<br>fix any confusion on whether the task of adding an animal has been started or<br>not.,Visual design is important here and often<br>overlooked; the button should be prevalent enough that it cannot be missed upon<br>first look, but will not get in the way of further interactions that do not<br>require the button.</td>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">The user fills out basic information about the animal such as: name, species, breed, gender, age, and whether it is a breeding animal.</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Text boxes on the screen will indicate that the<br>user should add information for this animal. This is standard for any text<br>entry, and the user should not have trouble entering text. The text boxes are<br>automatically triggered so that the keyboard will pop up on the screen when<br>they are clicked, further indicating that there should be text entered.</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">There is no “wrong” entry for the text boxes<br>because they are data local to the user; however, there may be trouble when<br>databases are merged into the cloud in order to search multiple users and<br>animals later. Erroneous entries such as misspelled species (ex: “Eguana”<br>instead of “Iguana”) may greatly hinder function of this app since the text<br>will function as a tag-based system instead of a category-based system. To fix<br>this, a drop down menu with various species and breeds of animals could be<br>added instead, such as “Siberian Cat” selected from a drop down menu instead of<br>simply “cat” entered in text, or “19” selected from a menu rather than<br>“nine-teen”.</td>

Photo recognition technology<br>could also be integrated to help automatically identify features of an animal<br>(like it's coat or pattern).</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Given that the targeted demographic of this app will be semi<br>or fully professional breeders, they will be motivated to give accurate<br>information about their animals in order to entice other breeders to look at<br>their animals and “match” them. Photos are also an easy way to differentiate<br>between each animal in a general visual overview of your full menagerie.</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Very specific instructions will have to be given for the<br>picture prompts, given that this is not a common practice for mobile apps. Separate screens or a “photos already added”<br>view should be implemented for this in<br>order to simplify each step of the photo-adding process, and eliminate any<br>doubt about where in the process the user currently is.</td>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">Given that the demographic of this app is likely to be<br>breeders interested in validating their animal’s heritage, the breeder will be<br>motivated to have their certificates authenticated. Additionally, this will allow for faster animal<br>matching, because the long and arduous process of having certificates<br>authenticated by traditional mail will be automatically done.</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">A picture of a certificate is not common practice in mobile<br>apps, and there will have to be very specific instructions in order to get a<br>good picture of the certificate for authentication. Alternatively, the user<br>could scan a copy of the certificate and upload it via mobile, but this is also<br>a rather roundabout method and not many users are likely to be motivated to do<br>this. Additionally, unless very good picture<br>recognition software is developed for this purpose, every certificate will have<br>to be verified by hand by either the database maintenance team, or the purebred<br>clubs themselves. Both of these options will require extensive teamwork from<br>the club to the app developer. Native partnership with the purebred clubs will<br>greatly simplify this process, as the app will be able to make use of the<br>already existing club authentication resources.</td>

## Brainstorm

For our brainstorming sessions, Mesa and Masih met after class to draw some sketches and discussed the ideas from each sketch.
Our document was then shared with Megan so she could add her own thoughts, as we weren't all able to meet at the same time.

Below are our notes on each sketch:

![](https://mkoma808.github.io/481-T03-Group5/images/P2/Mesa_Pictures/IMG_2148.jpg "Mesa sketch 2")
This was the most detailed sketch of what the UI should look like when adding a new animal, the order of the steps to add an animal were rearranged to form our storyboard.

![](https://mkoma808.github.io/481-T03-Group5/images/P2/Megan_Pictures/IMG_20170603_033937.jpg "Megan sketch 2")
This diagram shows a slightly more complex diagram of an animal's family tree, which would allow a breeder to see all of the offspring from the top down. This may present a challenge to implement as the spacing of the family tree may get large, but allowing for the user to zoom in and out should remedy this. Autorotate is also a feature we had not previously considered.

![](https://mkoma808.github.io/481-T03-Group5/images/P2/Masih_Pictures/IMG_1821.JPG "Masih sketch 2")
This diagram respents more of a "bare bones" user interface, where a user has a simple account, and basic searches are used to find pets. This UI also does not include a messaging service, and instead allows user to contact eachother through email. This diagram was not necessarily one of our best, but conveyed a very important idea: the complexity of some of our other ideas may be such that the user interface becomes either too cumbersome or too confusing.

## Reflection

Generally speaking, most of the brainstorming process was quite straight forward. The sketches really helped us figure out how to smooth out our designs, and put things in a sensible order. The affinity diagram helped us forus in on our ideas, but we may have used too broad of categories to group ideas into. The storyboard helped us identify an intuitive flow of information for the application, forcing us to visually understand how our user would use the app. There were difficulties in scheduling for the initial brainstorming process; with a short semester and one group member sick, there were some communication problems about what had happened during the brainstorming sessions. However, because the storyboard and video prototype were the next steps in the process, everybody quickly understood what was happening through the prototype process. 

If we were to do this differently next time, our group would try and focus less on large general overviews of how the entire app would look, and instead rough out general guidelines for app structure first. Then, we would have been able to more concretely look at the process of our user tasks and walkthroughs, allowing us to catch small details earlier on in the process; things like using different entry boxes, new screens for each part of the task, etc. This would have let us revise earlier iterations (the storyboard) more effectively, eliminating the need to later address small issues in task walkthroughs.
