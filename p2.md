## Video Prototype

[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNeLHtq01xo&feature=youtu.be)

This video captures a single pet entry to the database. Very much similar to the storyboard it shows how a user would interact with the interface as if it were a real
application. The first part of the video was the loading screen of the interface and then after a second the login screen would appear requesting an email and a password
or a Facebook login. Once the user enters the information it would take them to the home screen. Where they can see their pets. On the home screen you can search and you can have  drop down menu. In this case their wasn't any animals so at the bottom right you can request to add an animal. Once you do that you go to another page where you can specify if its a cat or dog you would like to add and some information regarding the pet. Once that happens you press next and you can upload a few images or you could "take a picture" which uses the camera on your device. You can upload as many pictures as you would like. It will let yo know if you added a picture successfully and after that's all done you would be asked to enter more information. If the pet is a purebred you would be asked to upload a certificate, upload a family tree which is optional,add a sire, add a dame, and add a registration number. Once that's all done you can submit your information which will be checked to verify your information. After you submit you would be directed back to the home screen where the animal you added will be upload.

## Storyboard

1.	User logs into app
2.	User clicks on the "+" button on the bottom righthand corner of the screen to add the animal.
3.	The user fills out basic information about the animal such as: name, species, breed, gender, age, and whether it is a breeding animal.
4.	The user uploads some picture of their animal, or takes some pictures of their animal. They will also be asked to take pictures of their animal from specific angles and distances so other breeders or buyers can see the features of the animal (so as to prevent fraud). Photo recognition technology could also be integrated to help automatically identify features of an animal (like it's coat or pattern).
5.	The user is then asked to enter detailed information on the traits of the animal (breed specific traits will also be loaded), such as it's length, height, eye colour, coat/pattern, ect. If the animal is purebred, the owner may also be asked to take pictures of the animal with a ruler or measuring tape next to it.
6.	If the animal is purebred, the owner will be asked to upload pictures of their animal's certificates to verify the authenticity of their claim. They will also be asked to enter any information about the animal's family tree that they have, and the registration numbers for the animal. The certificates will then be checked and the user will receive a notification when their animal has been authenticated as a purebred.
