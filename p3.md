## Highlight Walkthrough

### Task I : User wants to add single pet entry to database. The user would be specified to add a single entry after creating an account with detailed history of the pet.

The user enters an email and password, then clicks the "Login" button to login to their account.

The user presses the big plus button to add an animal to their account. They are then taken to the "Add Animal" page.

The user fills in the details about their pet and clicks "Submit" and then "Ok" or "No, keep editing".


### Task II: User wishes to calculate the inbreeding coefficient of two of his own animals. They want to find out whether two animals that they think are a match have a low inbreeding coefficient within his family hierarchy.

The user selects two of their animals, the breeding coefficient for the selected animals is then calculated and displayed.



### Task III: User wants to connect to other breeders and search for a “match” for a specific pet. The user has determined that their own animals have too high of a inbreeding coefficient to produce a healthy litter. The user wishes to find another animal from a different breeder within 25km of his current location in order to introduce genetic diversity into his breeding stock. He wants to find an animal with the lowest possible inbreeding coefficient.

The user selects the "Browse Breeders" option from the menu.


![](https://mkoma808.github.io/481-T03-Group5/images/P3/Task3/Distance.png)

The user types in their search criteria, chooses to sort the results by distance, and clicks "Search" and then a list of results are shown.

The user then selects an animal to see it's profile and calculate it's breeding coefficient.



## Heuristic Evaluation Results

The results of your heuristic analysis, where you identify a small set of major problems that must be fixed, and summarize these.

Then, describe the issues that were identified, along with which heuristics were violated, and finally, how you would address them in another iteration. 

You can sort these in terms of severity, in terms of functional/conceptual area (i.e. in a way that makes sense with respect to your system), or in terms of each heuristic. 

Justify your choice for presentation, and make it clear that sort is being done in the written presentation. 

You may not have enough space for everything: this is fine.

### Major issues that we identified:

* When adding an animal, both “Male” and “Female” radio buttons can be selected at the same time and cannot be un-selected.

  * Heuristic: Error Prevention
  
  * Severity: 4
  
  * Page: Add Animal
  
  * Justification: If a user adds and animal with both the “Male” and “Female” radio buttons selected, undefined actions and errors may occur and propigate issues throughout the entire system, especially since the database will need to check the gender of animals when searching for compatible breeders.
  
  * Solution: Link the "Male" and "Female" radio buttons together so that only one can be selected at a time, and add error handling conditions to the database to allow the database to function even if there is an error such as this.
  
  

* The “Facebook Login” button logs the user in without prompting them for any sort of authentication.

  * Heuristic: Consistency and standards
  
  * Severity: 4
  
  * Page: Login
  
  * Justification: Allowing a user to login to the app without prompting them for any sort of credencials is a serious stability and security issue. If a user logs in this way, would they have a unique user ID? Would all of the information they entered be lost once the app closed? Could you gain access to someone else's account by logging in this way? The fact that any of these questions must be asked is completely unacceptable, and this problem must be resolved as soon as possible.
  
  * Solution: Link the facebook login button to Facebook's API, and ensure that there is no way to login to the app without entering valid credentials.
  

* You can go through the process of adding an animal without filling out any information about it.

  * Heuristic: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
  
  * Severity: 4
  
  * Page: Add Animal
  
  * Justification: This app is meant to help breeders find other breeders and track the genealogy of their animals, in the world of purebreeding, it is absolutely essential that breeders have as much information about the animals that they are breeding as possible - allowing people to add animals without filling in relevant information about said animals completely defeats the purpose of this app and service
  
  * Solution: Do not allow users to add an animal without filling out all of the relevant information about said animal, especially if it is being listed as a purebred.
  

* When an animal is selected from the "Animal Overview" tab, it cannot be un-selected.

  * Heuristic: 
  
  * Severity: 
  
  * Page: 
  
  * Justification: 
  
  * Solution:
